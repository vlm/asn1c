GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The 3GPP TS 25.331 version 7.1.0 RRC (Radio Resource Control) PER decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../rrc-7.1.0.asn1 file.

OBTAINING THE RRC SPECIFICATION
================================

To obtain a different version of RRC ASN.1 specification, you should go to
	http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/25331.htm
and download any version of RRC specification you like.

A .ZIP file with a Microsoft Word .DOC files will download shortly.

You should extract the ASN.1 modules from the chapter 11 of that .DOC file.
Be careful not to copy any preambles, chapter titles and other non-ASN.1 text.

rrc-dump USAGE
==============

The rrc-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of a PER-encoded
RRC protocol data unit. Since RRC specification contains multiple PDUs,
a PDU must be selected manually using -p <PDU> command line option:

	./rrc-dump    -p DL-DCCH-Message    message.per
	./rrc-dump    -p PCCH-Message    message.per

The list of recognized PDUs may be obtained using `-p list`.

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./rrc-dump -h
