The crfc2asn1.pl script can be used to extract ASN.1 data from RFC texts.
For instance, it is used to extract X.509, MEGACO, and LDAPv3 ASN.1 modules
from the corresponding RFC texts (rfc3280.txt, rfc3525.txt, rfc4211.txt).

To regenerate the .asn1 files from the original RFC texts, execute
`make clean; make` in the current directory.
