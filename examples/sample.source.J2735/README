GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The SAE J2735-201603 Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)
Message Set Dictionary decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../J2735_201603.asn1 file.

Due to the fact that J2735 ASN.1 module reuses the same identifiers
in multiple contexts, the -fcompound-names command line option must
be specified on the asn1c command. The provided sample Makefile 
already has the option included but if you are not using that
Makefile, you must ensure that it is provided in your command line
in order to avoid getting 'redefinition' errors during the build
process.

THERE IS NO J2735_201603.asn1 FILE THERE YET!

OBTAINING THE J2735 SPECIFICATION
=================================

Go to http://standards.sae.org/j2735_201603/ and download the files.

You should extract the ASN.1 module from there and save it
as the ../J2735_201603.asn1 file. This file should start with
the following line

	DSRC DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=

and end with the "END" token.
Be careful not to copy any non-ASN.1 preambles from that .DOC file.

After obtaining the J2735_201603.asn1, type `make` in the directory
containing this README file.

j2735-dump USAGE
================

The j2735-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of the
UPER-encoded DSRC message record file:

	./j2735-dump j2735file.per	# Print as XML (BASIC-XER)

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./j2735-dump -h
