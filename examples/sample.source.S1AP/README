GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The 3GPP TS 36.413 version 14.4.0 S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) APER decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../s1ap-14.4.0.asn1 file.

OBTAINING THE S1AP SPECIFICATION
================================

To obtain a different version of S1AP ASN.1 specification, you should go to
	http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36413.htm
and download any version of S1AP specification you like.

A .ZIP file with a Microsoft Word .DOC files will download shortly.

You should extract the ASN.1 modules from the chapter 9 of that .DOC file.
Be careful not to copy any preambles, chapter titles and other non-ASN.1 text.

s1ap-dump USAGE
===============

The s1ap-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of a APER-encoded
S1AP protocol data unit. Since S1AP specification contains multiple PDUs,
a PDU must be selected manually using -p <PDU> command line option:

	./s1ap-dump -iaper -p S1AP-PDU message.per

The list of recognized PDUs may be obtained using `-p list`.

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./s1ap-dump -h
