GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The IEEE 1609.2-2016 "Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments --
Security Services for Applications and Management Messages" messages decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1 file.

THERE IS NO IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1 FILE THERE YET!

OBTAINING THE IEEE 1609.2-2016 SPECIFICATION
============================================

Download the standard containing the ASN.1 module files from
https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1609.2-2016.html

You should extract the ASN.1 modules from there and save it
into a single ../IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1 file. This file should start with
the following line

    IEEE1609dot2BaseTypes {iso(1) identified-organization(3) ieee(111)

or

    IEEE1609dot2 {iso(1) identified-organization(3) ieee(111)

(both of these modules should be present in the file; order is unimportant)
and end with the "END" token.
Be careful not to copy any non-ASN.1 preambles from that .DOC file.

After obtaining the IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1, type `make` in the directory
containing this README file.

1609-2-dump USAGE
=================

The 1609-2-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of the
OER-encoded Certificate file:

	./1609-2-dump 1609cert.oer	# Print as XML (BASIC-XER)

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./1609-2-dump -h
