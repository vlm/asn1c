GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The IEEE 1609.2-2016 "Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments --
Security Services for Applications and Management Messages" messages decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1 file.

Due to the fact that IEEE1609dot2 ASN.1 module reuses the same 
identifiers in multiple contexts, the -fcompound-names command
line option must be specified on the asn1c command. The provided
sample Makefile already has the option included but if you are
not using that Makefile, you must ensure that it is provided
in your command line in order to avoid getting 'redefinition'
errors during the build process.

THERE IS NO IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1 FILE THERE YET!

OBTAINING THE IEEE 1609.2-2016 SPECIFICATION
============================================

Download the standard containing the ASN.1 module files from
https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1609.2-2016.html

You should extract the ASN.1 modules from there and save it
into a single ../IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1 file. This file should start with
the following line

    IEEE1609dot2BaseTypes {iso(1) identified-organization(3) ieee(111)

or

    IEEE1609dot2 {iso(1) identified-organization(3) ieee(111)

(both of these modules should be present in the file; order is unimportant)
and end with the "END" token.
Be careful not to copy any non-ASN.1 preambles from that .DOC file.

After obtaining the IEEE-1609.2-2016.asn1, type `make` in the directory
containing this README file.

1609-2-dump USAGE
=================

The 1609-2-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of the
OER-encoded Certificate file:

	./1609-2-dump 1609cert.oer	# Print as XML (BASIC-XER)

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./1609-2-dump -h
