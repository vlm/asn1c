Mode of operation:

	Each of the *.in files is XER-decoded, then converted into DER or PER,
	then decoded back from DER (PER), then encoded into XER again,
	and finally compared to the original encoding.

Naming conventions:

*-B.in	-	The file is intentionally broken
*-D.in	-	Reconstructing should yield different data
*-E.in  -	CXER reconstruction should yield byte-wise identical data.
*-X.in  -	CXER reconstruction should yield non-identical data.

Otherwise, a reconstructed buffer should loosely match the original.
