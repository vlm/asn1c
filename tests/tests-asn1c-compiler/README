This is a collection of various little ASN.1 modules, used independently
by several different testing engines below the main tree (i.e. libasn1fix)
for stressing various aspects of compiler operation.

The files follow certain naming conventions:

Source file:
	<Index>-<arbitrary-name>-{OK|SE|NP}.asn1

Regenerator test file:
	<Index>-<arbitrary-name>-{OK|SE|NP}.asn1.[<compiler-flags>]

Where
	<Index> is arbitrary number (digits)
	<arbitrary-name> is arbitrary string, without dots
	OK	file syntax and semantics are absolutely correct
	SE	file semantics is wrong
	SW	file semantics is suspicious (warning)
	NP	file syntax is incorrect, file not parseable
	<compiler-flags>	command-line flags for compiler

Example:
	07-int-OK.asn1		# Correct ASN.1 file
	07-int-OK.asn1.-EF	# Test of file regeneration with -E -F flags.
