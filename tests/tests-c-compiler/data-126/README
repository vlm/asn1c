Mode of operation:

	Each of the *.in files is XER-decoded, then converted into PER,
	then compared with the .out file, then decoded back into XER
	and compared to the original .in file content.

Naming conventions:

*-C.in  -       Comparison of .out might fail, but decoding succeeds
*-P.in  -       PER decoding of .out file must fail.
*-X.in	-	Final XER comparison must fail.
