Mode of operation:

	Each of the *.in files is XER-decoded, then converted into PER,
	then decoded back from PER, then encoded into XER again,
	and finally compared to the original encoding.

Naming conventions:

*-B.in	-	The file is intentionally broken
*-P.in	-	Is not PER compatible, PER encoding must fail.
*-E.in  -	CXER reconstruction should yield byte-wise identical data.

Otherwise, a reconstructed buffer should loosely match the original.
